What did we do?

We coded and had problems with environments and things
Tried to write tests first, succeeded for a while, and sometimes didnt
Tried solving roman numeral problem
Got close, no sigar
attempted TDD
Started with tests, forgot about them a while
We tried solving roman numeral, spent some time thinking about what that is
set up environments ang git repos


What did learn?

Tdd is hard
Focusing on small changes is hard
5 minutes was just enough to start, and leave problem to the next person, or start over
Extremely hard to do pair programming with 4 people when hotseat is moved too often
Everybody implements their solution, doesnt make it progress
5 minutes is too little to understand what the previous person did
Being prepared with environment is important
Forced tdd makes you frustrated, even though it also trains you to think differently
Could force us into better habits by taking it to the extreme


What still puzzles us?

Roman numerals
How it will give value to do this
IS 5 minutes really the best?
How many times can we do this and still learn
Would we do it better if we didnt already have a notion of what to do


What did we decide?
We will do it again
Communicate
Different problem next time
